highlights terms in an aray in an exported excell workbook
Generates a new primary html file that the secondary workbook is nested in, removes references to the old workbook name.
Does not iterate through multiple workbooks at this time.
A possible solution to this is checking the XML file for more sheets then iterating through those sheets with another for loop.


This is just a quick and dirty script written to highlight asset numbers on a map build in excel to save time in locating assets.
